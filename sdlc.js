// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "The second step, in which infromation of the stakeholders needs (users/customers/development/teams, whoever will utilize the final project) are synthesized and formed into a list of requirments that the project will be built around and for."
const design = "The third step, during which clear plans for development are established. Key components, data flow, architectures, third party module implementation these are all things which are considered and developed and reviewed during this time in hopes of streamlining major development."
const implimentation = "The fourth step, during which all previous plans and requirments are utilized to begin building out in full the project. The clearer and more thorough the plan/design the smoother this step goes."
const testingAndIntegration = "The fifth step, in which the poject is nearly complete but must undergo testing of all components in order to identify any errors/problems or failuers to meet requirements. Once a problem is identified a solution if created and integrated. This testing and fixing step repeats untill all problems are fixed/adressed."
const maintain = "the sixth step, the project is 'finished', but not really. It is sent out into whatever market and no matter what will have to undergo some systems maitnence wether there is a third party update that needs to be integrated, there is a bug, or a new update/overhaul of a certain system is nessasary. Whichever of the numerous possibilities, there will be changes to be made after the project is 'finished'."
